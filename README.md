# AirQualityMonitoringSystem
This repository contains a bill of materials and necessary CAD files to create a homemade air quality monitoring system using an optical particle counter (OPC) sensor and a temperature/humidity/pressure/VOC sensor. CAD files for a container to hold the sensors, an MCU, and a power bank are included.
