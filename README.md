# AirQualityMonitoringSystem
This repository contains a bill of materials and necessary files to create a homemade air quality monitoring system using an optical particle counter (OPC) sensor and a temperature/humidity/pressure/VOC sensor. CAD files for a container to hold the sensors, MCU, and power bank are included. Additionally, the Arduino code used to program the MCU is posted as "Aerosol_sensor_V1.ino".
